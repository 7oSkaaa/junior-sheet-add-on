# junior-sheet-add-on
Sheet Automation is an add-on that automates setting the verdict of problems in [Mostafa Saad's junior sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/).

## Current progress
Currently the add-on fetches only `Codeforces` and `UVA` submissions, which is good as the sheet is 90% CF & UVA.
